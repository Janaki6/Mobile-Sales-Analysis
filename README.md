🚀 Sales Analysis Dashboard – Smarter Decisions with Data! 📊
Project: May 2025 #DataDNA Challenge by Onyx Data & ZoomCharts
Role: Data Analyst | Tools: Power BI | DAX | Visual Storytelling

In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze mobile phone sales data across multiple countries, cities, customer segments, and product attributes. The goal was to uncover meaningful insights that help businesses make data-driven decisions on product strategy, marketing, and sales operations.

📈 Key Insights Delivered

Top Markets: India and Turkey emerged as the strongest markets, closely followed by Bangladesh.

Buyer Profile: Females aged 26–33 are the top buyers, with a clear preference for premium brands like Apple and OnePlus.

Sales Channels: Over 60% of sales happen through online channels, with Credit Card and EMI as the leading payment modes.

Premium Models: Devices like the Samsung Z Fold 6 deliver high revenue per unit despite lower sales volume — indicating strong demand for flagship devices.

Brand Insights: Samsung remains the market leader in India and Pakistan, while niche brands carve out premium segments in metro cities.

⚙️ Tech & Tools
